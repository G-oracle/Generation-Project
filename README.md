# Generation-Project
  ## Final Python Project

Students will create a python program to process and table a payroll report.

The input data will be the following:
Employee Name; Pay Rate; hours worked. 

Overtime: For hours worked over 40 hours, employees will earn time and a half (rate*1.5). 
Subtract Fed Tax  10%, State tax 6%, FICA 3% from Gross Pay to calculate Net Pay

The Output should look the following:

        Employee Name    Hours Worked    Pay Rate      Regular Pay    OT Pay    Gross Pay   Fed Tax   State Tax      FICA                Net Pay

The program should run and be able to process 10 employees before ending.
